# Maroc Uber

Hi! This is the clone to the App based car booking Services like Uber using Flutter and Provider as a state management in it. Its unstable and i wont be maintaining it. You can find some usefull methods inside it, some of them are used as answeres on stackoverflow by me, releated to maps in flutter. You can also learn about maintaining the Complex UI on single screen and animations and there visibility using Provider.

Some Known issues and there solutions.
If you are running it, you will find some silly and annoying bugs.

You have to provide permission before running the application.
If you are providing permission on runtime, you have to restart the application (my poor ability to maintain statessssss)
Same goes for initializing the location service. You have to restart the application if location service is initiated on runtime.
